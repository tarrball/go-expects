# gophertest
Simple and intuitive test assertions for testing Go. You've tried the rest, now try this one.

<br />

# Version 0.4.0
I've created this little assertion package for two reasons:
  * take a personal tour of Go!
  * create an assertion syntax that I like.

<br />

# Step 1: Install
`go get github.com/tarrball/gophertest`

<br />

# Step 2: Import
`import github.com/tarrball/gophertest/expect`

<br />

# Step 3: Use it (optional: _enjoy_)!
It's supposed to be intuitive right? So how important could documentation _really_ be? Here's a little sample: 

TODO: an example.

# On the Roadmap
arrays, slices, maps, (ToContain, ToNotContain, ToBeNil, ToNotBeNil, etc)
